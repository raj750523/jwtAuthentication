## Introduction
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. This project provides an implementation for JWT authentication, including user registration, login, and accessing protected routes.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for Java projects)
- Node.js and npm (for JavaScript projects)
- An IDE or text editor of your choice

## Installation
### Java
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-authentication.git
    cd jwt-authentication
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Node.js
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-authentication.git
    cd jwt-authentication
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
### Java
1. Register a new user by sending a POST request to `/api/auth/register` with the user details.
2. Log in by sending a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with the username and password to receive a JWT token.
3. Access protected routes by including the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests.

### Node.js
1. Register a new user by sending a POST request to `/register` with the user details.
2. Log in by sending a POST request to `/login` with the username and password to receive a JWT token.
3. Access protected routes by including the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests.

## Endpoints
### Java
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - Request body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in to get a JWT token.
  - Request body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`
- `GET /api/protected`: Access a protected route.
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`

### Node.js
- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - Request body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`
- `POST /login`: Log in to get a JWT token.
  - Request body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`
- `GET /protected`: Access a protected route.
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
